# basic if / elif statement structure

# In a chained elif statement, the first condition
# to be true is the branch that gets executed
# and the rest are skipped.  If no condition is true
# the optional 'else' brance gets executed.
if True:    
    print('if true')
elif False:
    print('elif true')
else:
    print('neither true')
